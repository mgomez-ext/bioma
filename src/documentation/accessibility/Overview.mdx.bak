# Accessibility

Guidelines and best practices for creating accessible experiences in Bioma.

## WCAG Compliance

All Bioma components meet **WCAG AA** standards for:

- Color contrast
- Keyboard navigation
- Screen reader support
- Focus management

## Accessibility Principles

### Perceivable
Content must be presentable to users in ways they can perceive.

### Operable
Interface components must be operable by all users.

### Understandable
Information and operation must be understandable.

### Robust
Content must be robust enough to work with current and future technologies.

## Testing

Test your implementations with:

- Screen readers (NVDA, JAWS, VoiceOver)
- Keyboard navigation only
- Color blindness simulators
- Automated tools (axe, Lighthouse)
