# Welcome to Bioma 2.0 Design System

Bioma 2.0 is a comprehensive design system that provides the building blocks for creating consistent, accessible, and beautiful digital experiences.

## What is Bioma?

Bioma is more than just a component library—it's a complete design language that includes:

- **Design Tokens**: A semantic token system with 150+ tokens for colors, spacing, typography, and more
- **Components**: Pre-built, accessible UI components built with Angular
- **Foundations**: Core design principles for color, typography, spacing, and layout
- **Patterns**: Reusable solutions for common design problems
- **Guidelines**: Best practices for creating cohesive experiences

## Key Features

### 🎨 Semantic Token System
Bioma uses a two-level token architecture:
- **Foundation Tokens**: Primitive values (colors, spacing scales)
- **Semantic Tokens**: Contextual tokens that reference foundations

### 🌙 Dark Mode Support
Every component and token is designed with light and dark modes in mind, ensuring beautiful experiences in any context.

### ♿ Accessibility First
All components meet WCAG AA standards and include proper ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, and focus management.

### 📦 Framework Agnostic Tokens
While components are built with Angular, design tokens can be used in any framework or platform.

## Design Principles

### Consistency
Maintain visual and functional consistency across all touchpoints through shared components and patterns.

### Accessibility
Create inclusive experiences that work for everyone, regardless of ability or device.

### Efficiency
Speed up design and development with reusable components and clear documentation.

### Flexibility
Adapt to different contexts while maintaining the core Bioma identity.
